      <p>
        I am a front-end web developer with a Bachelors in Psychology from the
        University of San Francisco with additional study of Java programming
        and web design at East Los Angeles College. I have recently completed a
        certificate in full-stack web development from the UCLA Extension Coding
        Bootcamp with newly developed skills in CSS, JavaScript, React,
        SQL/NoSQL Databases, and Responsive Web Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am adaptable, self-motivated, and have an eye for detail which I use
        to create and debug a variety of web-based projects. With my psychology
        background, I take particular interest in creating websites that adhere
        to accessibility standards while still creating an appealing client
        experience. I am eager to continue acquiring new skills, learn from
        future mentors and team members alike, and leverage my passion for
        individuals and technical web development skills to develop better
        experiences on the web.
